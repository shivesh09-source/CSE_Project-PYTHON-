# 🎯 Project Statement: Python Number Theory Implementation

## 1. Problem Statement
Many foundational concepts in **Number Theory, Discrete Mathematics, and Cryptography** require specialized algorithmic implementations for effective study and application. The problem is the need for a **unified, modular, and reliable Python library** that provides tested implementations for a diverse range of 34 specific functions. This project addresses the lack of a single, focused resource by implementing, testing, and documenting all required functions as independent, reusable modules.

## 2. Scope of the Project
The scope of this project is strictly limited to the **backend implementation and validation** of the 34 mathematical functions specified in the course assignment.

### In Scope:
* Developing 34 distinct Python functions, each solving a specific Number Theory problem (e.g., `factorial(n)`, `pollard_rho(n)`, `is_carmichael(n)`).
* Ensuring **modular design** with clear input and output for every function.
* Implementing a robust **testing approach** (unit tests) for mathematical correctness.
* Adhering to version control standards using Git.

### Out of Scope:
* Development of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or a web interface.
* Integration with external databases or APIs.
* Real-time performance tuning beyond basic algorithmic efficiency (e.g., using Modular Exponentiation).

## 3. Target Users
The primary target users are:
1.  **Students:** Undergraduate and graduate students studying **Number Theory, Cryptography, and Discrete Mathematics** who require tested code for verification and practical learning.
2.  **Educators/Researchers:** Individuals needing quick, reference-ready implementations of fundamental algorithms.
3.  **Python Developers:** Those looking for a dedicated library of mathematically correct, foundational number theory tools for integration into larger projects.

## 4. High-Level Features
The project provides three major functional modules, encompassing the 34 required functions:

| Module | Core Functionality | Examples (High-Level) |
| **I. Number Properties** | Checks for classic number types and properties. | Palindrome check, Harshad number check, Aliquot sum, Divisor counting. |
| **II. Primality & Factorization** | Implements algorithms for testing primality and finding factors. | Miller-Rabin Primality Test, Pollard's Rho factorization, Prime Power check. |
| **III. Modular Arithmetic & Advanced Math** | Solves problems in modular arithmetic and implements advanced mathematical series. | Modular Exponentiation, Modular Inverse, Lucas Sequence Generation, Riemann Zeta approximation. |
